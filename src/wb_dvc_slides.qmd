## On version control {.center}

I won't introduce here the benefits of using a good version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

![On the benefits of VCS](img/vc.jpg){width="45%"}

## Extending Git for data {.center}

While Git is a wonderful tool for text files versioning (code, writings in markup formats), it isn't a tool to manage changes to datasets

Several open source tools—each with a different structure and functioning—extend Git capabilities to track data: [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/), [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/), [lakeFS](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS), [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt), [DataLad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad)

## Extending Git for models and experiments {.center}

Reproducible research and collaboration on data science and machine learning projects involve more than datasets management:

Experiments and the models they produce also need to be tracked

## Many moving parts {.center}

# Enters DVC

## DVC principles {.center}

Large files (datasets, models...) are kept outside Git \
Each large file or directory put under DVC tracking has an associated `.dvc` file \
Git only tracks the `.dvc` files (metadata)

. . .

Workflows can be tracked for collaboration and reproducibility

. . .

DVC functions as a Makefile and allows to only rerun what is necessary

## Installation {.center}

For Linux (other OSes, refer to [the doc](https://dvc.org/doc/install)):

- `pip`:

	```{.bash}
	pip install dvc
	```

- `conda`

- [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) (if you want `dvc` available everywhere without having to activate virtual envs):

	```{.bash}
	pipx install dvc
	```

:::{.note}

Optional dependencies `[s3]`, `[gdrive]`, etc. for remote storage

:::

## How to run {.center}

- Terminal

	```{.bash}
	dvc ...
	```

- [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iterative.dvc)

- Python library if installed via `pip` or `conda`

	```{.python}
	import dvc.api
	```

:::{.notenoline}

In this webinar, I will use DVC through the command line

:::

## Acknowledgements {.center}

Code and data for this webinar modified from:

- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)
- [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org/)
- [DVC documentation](https://dvc.org/doc)

## The project {.center}

## Initialize Git repo {.center}

```{.bash}
git init
```

```
Initialized empty Git repository in dvc/.git/
```

. . .

This creates the `.git` directory

. . .

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
	LICENSE
	data/
	requirements.txt
	src/
```

## Initialize DVC project {.center}

```{.bash}
dvc init
```

```
Initialized DVC repository.

You can now commit the changes to git.
```

:::{.notenoline}

You will also see a note about usage analytics collection and info on how to opt out

:::

. . .

A `.dvc` directory and a `.dvcignore` file got created

## Commit DVC system files {.center}

:::{.note}

DVC automatically staged its system file for us:

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
	new file:   .dvc/.gitignore
	new file:   .dvc/config
	new file:   .dvcignore

Untracked files:
	LICENSE
	data/
	requirements.txt
	src/
```

:::

So we can directly commit:

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Initialize DVC"
```

## Prepare repo {.center}

Let's work in a virtual environment:

```{.bash}
# Create venv and add to .gitignore
python -m venv venv && echo venv > .gitignore

# Activate venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Update pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install packages needed
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Clean working tree {.center}

```{.bash}
git add .gitignore LICENSE requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add general files"
git add src
git commit -m "Add scripts"
```

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch main
Untracked files:
	data/
```

. . .

:::{.note}

Now, it is time to deal with the data

:::

# Tracking data with DVC

## Put data under DVC tracking {.center}

We are still not tracking any data:

```{.bash}
dvc status
```

```
There are no data or pipelines tracked in this project yet.
```

You can choose what to track as a unit (i.e. each picture individually, the whole `data` directory as a unit)

Let's break it down by set:

```{.bash}
dvc add data/raw/train
dvc add data/raw/val
```

## {.center}

This adds data to `.dvc/cache/files` and created 3 files in `data/raw`:

- `.gitignore`
- `train.dvc`
- `val.dvc`

The `.gitignore` tells Git not to track the data:

```{.bash}
cat data/raw/.gitignore
```

```
/train
/val
```

The `.dvc` files contain the metadata for the cached directories

## Tracked data {.center}

We are all good:

```{.bash}
dvc status
```

```
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

## Data (de)duplication {.center}

Link between checked-out version of a file/directory and the cache:

|                |Duplication   |Editable
|----------------|:-:|:-:
|Reflinks*         |Only when needed|Yes
|Hardlinks/Symlinks|No            |No     
|Copies            |Yes	       |Yes

: Cache ⟷ working directory {tbl-colwidths="[44, 28, 28]"}

[*Reflinks only available for a few file systems (Btrfs, XFS, OCFS2, or APFS)]{.aside}

## Commit the metafiles {.center}

The metafiles should be put under Git version control

:::{.note}

You can configure DVC to automatically stage its newly created system files:

```{.bash}
dvc config [--system] [--global] core.autostage true
```

:::

You can then commit directly:

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Initial version of data"
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Track changes to the data {.center}

Let's make some change to the data:

```{.bash}
rm data/raw/val/n03445777/ILSVRC2012_val*
```

. . .

Remember that Git is not tracking the data:

```{.bash}
git status
```

```{.bash}
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

. . .

But DVC is:

```{.bash}
dvc status
```

```
data/raw/val.dvc:
	changed outs:
	        modified:           data/raw/val
```

## Add changes to DVC {.center}

```{.bash}
dvc add data/raw/val
dvc status
```

```
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

. . .

Now we need to commit the changes to the `.dvc` file to Git:

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
	modified:   data/raw/val.dvc
```

:::{.note}

Staging happened automatically because I have set the `autostage` option to `true` on my system

:::

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Delete data/raw/val/n03445777/ILSVRC2012_val*"
```

## Check out older versions {.center}

What if we want to go back to the 1st version of our data?

For this, we first use Git to checkout the proper commit, then run `dvc checkout` to have the data catch up to the `.dvc` file

To avoid forgetting to run the commands that will make DVC catch up to Git, we can automate this process by installing Git hooks:

```{.bash}
dvc install
```

---

Now, all we have to do is to checkout the commit we want:

```{.bash}
git log --oneline
```

```
94b520b (HEAD -> main) Delete data/raw/val/n03445777/ILSVRC2012_val*
92837a6 Initial version of data
dd961c6 Add scripts
db9c14e Initialize repo
7e08586 Initialize DVC
```

```{.bash}
git checkout 92837a6
```

The version of the data in the working directory got automatically switched to match the `.dvc` file:

```{.bash}
dvc status
```

```
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

You can look at your files to verify that the deleted files are back

## Git workflows {.center}

`git checkout` is ok to have a look, but a detached HEAD is not a good place to create new commits

Let's create a new branch and switch to it:

```{.bash}
git switch -c alternative
```

```
Switched to a new branch 'alternative'
```

Going back and forth between both versions of our data is now as simple as switching branch:

```{.bash}
git switch main
git switch alternative
```

# Collaboration

## Classic workflow {.center}

The Git project (including `.dvc` files) go to a Git remote (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/server)

The data go to a DVC remote (AWS/Azure/Google Drive/server/etc.)

## DVC remotes {.center}

DVC can use many cloud storage or remote machines/server via SSH, WebDAV, etc.

Let's create a local remote here:

```{.bash}
# Create a directory outside the project
mkdir ../remote

# Setup default (-d) remote
dvc remote add -d local_remote ../remote
```

```
Setting 'local_remote' as a default remote.
```

```{.bash}
cat .dvc/config
```

```
[core]
    remote = local_remote
['remote "local_remote"']
    url = ../../remote
```

## Commit remote config {.center}

The new remote configuration should be committed:

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch alternative

Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   .dvc/config
```

```{.bash}
git add .
git commit -m "Config remote"
```

## Push to remotes {.center}

Let's push the data from the cache (`.dvc/cache`) to the remote:

```{.bash}
dvc push
```

```
2702 files pushed
```

:::{.note}

With Git hooks installed, `dvc push` is automatically run after `git push`

(But the data is pushed to the DVC remote while the files tracked by Git get pushed to the Git remote)

:::

By default, the entire data cache gets pushed to the remote, but there are many options

:::{.example}

Example: only push data corresponding to a certain `.dvc` files


```{.bash}
dvc push data/raw/val.dvc
```

:::

## Pull from remotes {.center}

`dvc fetch` downloads data from the remote into the cache. To have it update the working directory, follow by `dvc checkout`

You can do these 2 commands at the same time with `dvc pull`

# Tracking experiments

## DVC pipelines {.center}

DVC pipelines create reproducible workflows and are functionally similar to Makefiles

Each step in a pipeline is created with `dvc stage add` and add an entry to a `dvc.yaml` file

:::{.note}

`dvc stage add` options:

`-n`: name of stage \
`-d`: dependency \
`-o`: output

:::

. . .

Each stage contains:

- `cmd`: the command executed
- `deps`: the dependencies
- `outs`: the outputs

The file is then used to visualize the pipeline and run it

## Example {.center}

Let's create a pipeline to run a classifier on our data

The pipeline contains 3 steps:

- prepare
- train
- evaluate


## Create a pipeline {.center}

1^st^ stage (data preparation):

```{.bash}
dvc stage add -n prepare -d src/prepare.py -d data/raw \
	-o data/prepared/train.csv -o data/prepared/test.csv \
	python src/prepare.py
```

```
Added stage 'prepare' in 'dvc.yaml'
```

. . .

2^nd^ stage (training)

```{.bash}
dvc stage add -n train -d src/train.py -d data/prepared/train.csv \
	-o model/model.joblib \
	python src/train.py
```

```
Added stage `train` in 'dvc.yaml'
```

. . .

3^rd^ stage (evaluation)

```{.bash}
dvc stage add -n evaluate -d src/evaluate.py -d model/model.joblib \
    -M metrics/accuracy.json \
    python src/evaluate.py
```

```
Added stage `evaluate` in 'dvc.yaml'
```

## Commit pipeline {.center}

```{.bash}
git commit -m "Define pipeline"
```

```
prepare:
	changed deps:
	        modified:           data/raw

```

## Run pipeline {.center}

```{.bash}
dvc repro
```

```
'data/raw/train.dvc' didn't change, skipping
'data/raw/val.dvc' didn't change, skipping
Running stage 'prepare':
> python src/prepare.py
Generating lock file 'dvc.lock'
Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'

Running stage 'train':
> python src/train.py
Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'

Running stage 'evaluate':
> python src/evaluate.py
Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'
Use `dvc push` to send your updates to remote storage.
```

## dvc repro breakdown {.center}

- `dvc repro` runs the `dvc.yaml` file in a Makefile fashion

- First, it looks at the dependencies: the data didn't change

- Then it ran the commands to produce the outputs (since it is our first run, we had no outputs)

- When the 1^st^ stage is run, a `dvc.lock` is created with information on that part of the run

- When the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ stages are run, `dvc.lock` is updated

  At the end of the run `dvc.lock` contains all the info about the run we just did (version of the data used, etc.)

- A new directory called `runs` is created in `.dvc/cache` with cached data for this run

## Results of the run {.center}

- The prepared data was created in `data/prepared` (with a `.gitignore` to exclude it from Git—you don't want to track results in Git, but the scripts that can reproduce them)

- A model was saved in `model` (with another `.gitignore` file)

- The accuracy of this run was created in `metrics`

## Clean working tree {.center}

Now, we definitely want to create a commit with the `dvc.lock`

We could add the metrics resulting from this run in the same commit:

```{.bash}
git add metrics
git commit -m "First pipeline run and results"
```

. . .

Our working tree is now clean and our data/pipeline up to date:

```{.bash}
git status
```

```
On branch alternative
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```{.bash}
dvc status
```

```
Data and pipelines are up to date.
```

## Modify pipeline {.center}

From now on, if we edit one of the scripts, or one of the dependencies, `dvc status` will tell us what changed and `dvc repro` will only rerun the parts of the pipeline to update the result, pretty much as a Makefile would

## Going further ... next time {.center}
