[JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/) is an open source Python library for high-performance array computing and flexible automatic differentiation.

High-performance computing is achieved by [asynchronous dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)), [just-in-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation), the [XLA compiler for linear algebra](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), and full compatibility with accelerators ([GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) and [TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit)).

Automatic differentiation uses [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and works with complex control flows (conditions, recursions), second and third-order derivatives, forward and reverse modes. This makes JAX ideal for machine learning and neural network libraries such as [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are built on it.

This course will teach you the basics of JAX and is a prerequisite for the following machine learning course on [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You do not need to install anything on your machine for this course as we will provide access to a temporary remote cluster.
